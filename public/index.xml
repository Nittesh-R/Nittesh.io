      <description>Preview In a world that often measures worth by perceived perfection, there exists a soul whose journey defies every expectation. Born with disorders that set them apart from their peers, they faced a childhood marked by misunderstanding and adversity. Yet, through every trial inflicted by others&amp;rsquo; ignorance and cruelty, they forged an inner strength fueled by resilience and a relentless spirit. Their story is not merely one of survival but of defiance‚Äîa testament to the human spirit&amp;rsquo;s capacity to rise above circumstances.</description>

      <description>Abstract Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells. Several hypotheses for AD exists (e.g., cholinergic, amyloid, tau hypotheses, etc.). As per the cholinergic hypothesis, the deficiency of choline is responsible for AD; therefore, the inhibition of AChE is a lucrative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that is essential for cognition and memory.</description>
